Description: Simulates the cultural evolution of quantitative traits of bird song. 'SongEvo' is an individual- (agent-) based model. 'SongEvo' is spatially-explicit and can be parameterized with, and tested against, measured song data. Functions are available for model implementation, sensitivity analyses, parameter optimization, model validation, and hypothesis testing.
